# Nonlinear Harmonic Oscillator: Learning Koopman Operators with cVAE ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to this exciting repository! ðŸŒŸ This project aims to uncover the underlying dynamics of nonlinear harmonic oscillators using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAE) to learn Koopman Operators. This topic is a treasure trove for anyone interested in leveraging machine learning for understanding nonlinear dynamical systems.

## What's Inside? :file_folder:

The repository is neatly organized with each file serving a specific purpose:

- `./data_generator.py`: Generates time-series data for the nonlinear harmonic oscillator, considering multiple initial conditions.
  
- `./cVAE.py`: Houses the `cVAE` class, the backbone of our machine learning approach to learning the low-rank approximation of the Koopman Operator.
  
- `./learn.py`: Executes the training loop for our cVAE, optimized with hyperparameters through Bayesian Optimization.
  
- `./test.py`: Evaluates the performance of the trained model and visualizes the predicted dynamics.

## Diving into the Machine Learning Magic ðŸŒŸ

The `cVAE.py` file contains the blueprint of our Conditional Variational Autoencoder, designed to capture the nonlinear dynamics in its latent space. By learning a Koopman Operator, the cVAE transforms complex, nonlinear dynamics into linear dynamics in the latent space, making future state predictions more tractable.

The data generator in `data_generator.py` employs numerical methods to simulate the nonlinear harmonic oscillator, creating a rich dataset that considers a wide range of initial conditions.

Finally, `test.py` allows you to see the learned dynamics in action, comparing predicted states with actual states to measure the model's performance.

## Getting Started :runner:

To kickstart your journey, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joseph-crowley/learned-koopman.git
cd learned-koopman
```

Ensure that you have Python 3.x:

```bash
